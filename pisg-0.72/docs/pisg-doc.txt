                            Chapter 1. What is pisg?

   pisg is an IRC statistics generator. It takes IRC logfiles and turns them
   into nice looking stats.

   In general, you would do something like this to get it running:

     *  Enable logging in an IRC bot, or in your IRC client. The log will be
       outputted into a file.

     *  You set up pisg, you define the channel name, and the path to the
       logfile you created.

     *  You run pisg, pisg runs the log through and create statistics, it
       then creates an HTML page which you can upload to a webserver.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

1.1. What are the requirements to run pisg?



     *  An IRC client or bot where pisg supports the output logfile.

     *  Any operating system which Perl runs on, this includes popular OSes
       such as Linux, FreeBSD, Windows and Mac. You will have a hard time
       finding an OS where Perl isn't supported. For Windows this means that
       you need to download ActivePerl.

     *  Optional - a system to host the statistics page 24 hours a day, 7
       days a week.

     *  Optional - a system to log the channel, 24 hours a day, 7 days a
       week.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

                 Chapter 2. Setting up pisg for the first time

   Most configuration happens through the pisg.cfg file, the file format is
   made to be easy to read, and easy to extend for further use. It uses an
   XML-like format, with elements and attributes.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

2.1. Setting up a channel

   An element called Channel is made for defining channels, a quick example
   of a channel is here:

   
     <channel="#channel">
      Logfile = "channel.log"
      Format = "mIRC"
      Maintainer = "John"
      OutputFile = "mychan.html"
     </channel>
   
   

   The above will define a Channel called #channel, the logfile pisg will
   look for is called channel.log and the Format of the logfile will be mIRC.
   The Maintainer (which will be stated on the output page) is John.

   That is basically it! Now, there are a lot more options that you can use
   for your channels, for this please refer to the reference documentation.

   Also be-aware of the fact that pisg uses various images to show the
   time-related bars. These images are placed in the gfx/ folder and should
   be placed into the same directory as your outputted HTML file.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

2.2. Specifying user options

   User options are set with a simple XML-like syntax in the form:

    <user nick="NICK" option="VALUE">
   

   Remember, the nick is always required. For example to add aliases to a
   nick, then you could do this:

     <user nick="Joe" alias="Joe^*">
    

   The asterisk (*) means that it will match all nicks starting with 'Joe^'.
   So it will add all Joe^'s to 'Joe' in the stats. Another thing you can do
   is to add a picture to a user:

     <user nick="Ben" pic="ben_holiday.jpg">
    

   If you have a larger picture of the user as well, you can make the picture
   on the stats page link to it:

      <user nick="Ben" pic="ben_holiday.jpg" bigpic="ben-big.jpg">
    

   You can include * or ? to enable filename globbing to randomly choose one
   from several pictures: (see documentation for the ImageGlobPath option)

     <user nick="Ben" pic="ben_*.jpg">
    

   You can also set a user's sex. The sex setting can be "f"emale, "m"ale, or
   "b"ot:

     <user nick="Ben" sex="m">
    

   Also you can add links to URLs and e-mails:

     <user nick="Christine" link="http://www.christine.com">
    

   or

     <user nick="Chris" link="chris@host.com">
    

   The last thing you can do is to ignore nicks (for example bots):

     <user nick="nameofbot" ignore="y">
    

   You don't have to do all this in many lines, you could just as easily do:

     <user nick="Joe" alias="Joe^away Joe^work" pic="joe.jpg" link="joe@joe.com" sex="m">
    

   (Here the aliases are a space separated list of nicks, that also works!
   But * as a wildcard is smarter, although it is slower).

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

2.3. Setting global options

   Many times, it will be useful to set up global options, global options are
   set like this:

      <set option="VALUE">
     

   Any global option will be overriden by anything defined within channel
   elements (see Section 2.1)

   For example, to change the background color of the stats page, you could
   do:

      <set bgcolor="black">
     

   You can set many options in a single set:

      <set lang="DE" timeoffset="+1">
     

   The above will set the language on the statistics page to DE (Deutsch,
   German) and set the time offset to +1. All options available are mentioned
   in the reference documentation.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

2.4. Ignoring links

   It's possible to ignore links in the "Most referenced URLs" section:

    
      <link url="http://www.slashdot.org" ignore="y">
    
    

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

2.5. Including common settings for various channels

   If you have, for example, more than one channel, where the users are the
   same, or you don't want to maintain more than one user file, you can use
   the "include" setting in the main config file:

    
      <include="/home/vetinari/pisg/users.cfg">
    
    

   This will include the file /home/vetinari/pisg/users.cfg in the config at
   the place where the include statement is set.

   Note, that you can NOT include a file from an included file!

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

2.6. Changing the layout of your stats page

   The standard layout and colors in the outputted HTML page are made to be
   somewhat clean and neutral. But you have the chance to change the layout
   yourself.

   There are a few predefined color schemes for you to use, use the
   ColorScheme option when using them. The colorschemes distributed with pisg
   are: default (which is the default), darkgalaxy, darkred, justgrey, ocean,
   orange_grey, pisg, softgreen.

   When changing it, you need a fair knowledge of CSS (Cascading Style
   Sheets). CSS is what most of the web uses today to define styles and
   layout on HTML pages. With the pisg distribution, look in the layout
   directory. In it resides default.css which is the file being included onto
   the HTML page. Open it in a text editor like vi or notepad. Then change it
   until you're happy with it. Be aware that you might want to look at the
   HiCell and HiCell2 options through pisg.cfg for changing the last two
   colors.

   If you have created a nice stylesheet which other can take advantage of,
   you are encouraged to send it to the pisg mailing list so that it can be
   distributed with the next version of pisg.

   If you want to embed the statistics into another page, use the "none"
   color scheme. Pisg will then omit the HTML header and write only the body
   part.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

2.7. Running pisg

   When everything is set up in the pisg configuration file (pisg.cfg), then
   you simply run pisg on the command-line.

   Using Linux, BSD or another UNIX-like system:

     user@host:pisg-0.37$ ./pisg
    

   Using Windows:

     c:\pisg> perl pisg
    

   The program will run and parse the logfiles you specified in the
   configuration file.

   If you are using Linux, BSD or another UNIX-like system and want run pisg
   automatically several times a day, then see the crontab file in the
   scripts/ directory.

   For Windows, see the windows-upload-ftp.txt file with the pisg
   distribution, this file is also placed in the scripts/ directory.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

2.8. Obtaining help and reporting bugs

   If your problem could not be resolved through here, then you should send
   an e-mail to the pisg mailing list. You can subscribe and see more info at
   http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/pisg-general.

   If you believe that you have found a bug, you should use the SourceForge
   bug tracking system.

          Maintainer = "John"
         </channel>
      
     

Description
-----------

   Channel is used in two contexts, globally when using <set> and when
   defining new channels. It sets the name of the channel.

Default

   Unset

                                     Format

          Maintainer = "John"
         </channel>

         <set Format="mIRC">
      
    

Description
-----------

   Format is used to define the format of the logfile, pisg supports a
   various number of different logfiles, see the FORMATS file included with
   the pisg distribution. If your logfiles have the suffix .gz or .bz2, they
   will automatically be decompressed and read by pisg. See also Maintainer.

Default

   Unset

                                    Network

-----------------------
Default option

   Network -- the IRC network of the channel

Synopsis
--------

      
         <channel="#channel">
          Logfile = "channel.log"
          Format = "eggdrop"
          Network = "Undernet"
         </channel>

         <set Network="Quakenet">

   Network is used to set the network which the channel resides on, this name
   is displayed on the stats page.

Default

   SomeIRCNetwork

                                   OutputFile

-----------------------
Default option
-----------------------

   OutputFile -- name of the generated HTML page

Synopsis
--------

      
         <channel="#channel">
          Logfile = "channel.log"
          Format = "eggdrop"
          OutputFile = "mychan.html"
         </channel>

         <set OutputFile="mychan.html">
      
    

Description
-----------

   OutputFile is used to define the name of the generated statistics page.

Default

   index.html

                                   OutputTag

-----------------------
Default option
-----------------------

   OutputTag -- tag to insert into OutputFile

Synopsis
--------

      
         <channel="#channel">
          LogDir = "logs/"
          Format = "eggdrop"
          OutputFile = "mychan%t.html"
          OutputTag = "-week"
         </channel>

         <set OutputTag="-week">
      
    

Description
-----------

   OutputTag specifies a string that will replace occurrences of "%t" in
   OutputFile. This option is most useful when used as a command line switch
   (-t) to pisg in conjunction with NFiles (-nf). Example:

      
       $ pisg -co pisg.conf
       $ pisg -co pisg.conf -nf 8 -t -week
      
    

   Leaving out the OutputTag settings from the above pisg.conf snippet, this
   writes both the full statistics (mychan.html) and statistics for the last
   week (mychan-week.html) using the same pisg config file. (Assuming that
   there are separate logfiles for each day.)

Default

   unset

                                    Logfile

-----------------------
Default option
-----------------------

   Logfile -- name of logfile to parse

Synopsis
--------

      
         <channel="#channel">
          Logfile="/home/foo/eggdrop/logs/mylog.txt"
          Format = "eggdrop"
         </channel>

         <set Logfile="foo.log">
      
    

Description
-----------

   This defines the filename of the logfile to parse for the channel. If you
   want to parse a directory full of logfiles, you should use the LogDir
   option instead. Providing this option multiple times will parse multiple
   files in the order the statements appear. Wildcards (* ? []) will be
   expanded. See also LogDir and NFiles.

Default

   unset

                                     LogDir

-----------------------
Default option
-----------------------

   LogDir -- parse a directory full of logs

Synopsis
--------

      
         <channel="#channel">
          LogDir="/home/foo/eggdrop/logs/"
          Format = "eggdrop"
         </channel>

         <set LogDir="dailylogs/">
      
    

Description
-----------

   When LogDir is defined to valid path to a directory, then pisg will run
   through that directory, parse all logfiles in it and create one HTML page
   from it. Useful with for example eggdrop logs. Providing this option
   multiple times will parse all the files in multiple directories in the
   order the statements appear. See also NFiles, LogPrefix, and LogSuffix.

Default

   unset

                                     NFiles

-----------------------
Default option
-----------------------

   NFiles -- parse only the last files in LogDir

Synopsis
--------

      
         <channel="#channel">
          LogDir="/home/foo/eggdrop/logs/"
          NFiles="8"
          Format="eggdrop"
         </channel>

         <set NFiles="8">
      
    

Description

   page, this can be either the person generating the stats or the bot/client
   doing the logging. The maintainer is displayed in the outputted stats
   page. This setting is also used by some log parsers where "You" is used
   instead of the nick in the log (e.g. "You have been kicked"). See also

         <set ColorScheme="default">
      
    

Description
-----------

   ColorScheme is used to define the color scheme used for the statistics
   page. Actually it's the CSS file being included. CSS files distributed
   with pisg are: darkgalaxy, darkred, default, justgrey, ocean, orange_grey,
   pisg, softgreen (omit the .css). The file will be included statically in
   the generated HTML page. If you give a file name or URL (i.e. a color
   scheme name with .css or a path), the file will be linked to instead.
   Using "none" will cause pisg to write only the body of the page; use this
   to include the statistics into a custom page. See also CssDir,
   AltColorScheme, HiCell/HiCell2.

Description
-----------

   PageHead is used to include a file in the stats page, for example an
   introduction text, a link to an image or a banner. The file can hold
   anything, it will be included raw in the stats page - so HTML should be
   preferred. The file will be included in the top of the page. This option

         <set PageFoot="somefooter.txt">
      
    

Description

   PageFoot is used to include a file in the stats page, for example an
   introduction text, a link to an image or a banner. The file can hold
   anything, it will be included raw in the stats page - so HTML should be
   preferred. The file will be included in the bottom of the page. This

Description
-----------

   LogSuffix is used to define the suffix of a logfile, it only works when
   LogDir is defined. The example in the synopsis is for the eggdrop bots
   default format.

Default

   Unset

                                     Silent

-----------------------
Default option
-----------------------

   Silent -- make pisg silent, suppress messages

Synopsis
--------

      
         <set Silent="1">
      
    

Description
-----------

   This option is useful mainly from command line when invoking pisg with
   --silent 1. But it can also used in the configuration file. It will
   suppress all standard output from pisg. Error messages will still be sent.

Default

   0 (disabled)

                                    CacheDir

-----------------------
Default option
-----------------------

   CacheDir -- use a cache to speed up log parsing

Synopsis

         <set CacheDir="pisg_cache">
         <set CacheDir="/path/to/pisg_cache">
      
    

Description
-----------

   Setting this option makes pisg dump the results of log parsing into cache
   files. The next time pisg is run, it compares the timestamp of the log(s)
   with the timestamp stored in the cache file. When the log was not changed,
   the cached data is used. (This means that it does not work if you only
   have a single big logfile. Split the log at arbitrary points and use
   LogDir or Logfile="dir/*".)

   Note that the cache files should be deleted when the pisg config file is
   changed since the cache data uses the old config settings. NickTracking
   does not work especially well with the cache when using different NFiles
   settings.

Default

   Unset

         <set UserPics="3">
      
    

Description
-----------

   UserPics allows you to configure the number of user pictures per row. Per
   default, one picture will be shown. Since pictures are usually higher than
   one line of text, this lets the table grow. With settings greater than 1,
   several pictures will be placed next to each other. A good setting would
   be UserPics=3 and pictures of size 60x60. Set UserPics to no or 0 to
   disable user pictures. The latter is useful if you share a user config
   file between channels and want to disable user pictures for some channels.

   located, relative to the current directory. This setting is used to choose
   random pictures if ? or * (globbing characters) are used in the picture
   name. ? matches a single character, * matches a (possibly empty) string.
   The default is the ImagePath setting. (NB: This setting will be different
   from ImagePath if the latter is not relative to the current directory,
   e.g. if you are writing the HTML file outside of the current directory.)

-----------------------
Default option
-----------------------

   Charset -- character set to use for stats page

Synopsis

         </channel>

         <set Charset="iso-8859-15">
      
    

Description
-----------

   The pisg stats page defines a character set in a meta tag, this can be
   used if your country is using a different one than the default. Pisg will
   also use this setting to convert the language templates from LangFile if
   the language defines a source charset. Note: you also have to tell your
   webserver to transmit the charset to the browser. With Apache, use
   "AddDefaultCharset off" in the server config.

Default

   iso-8859-1

                                   LogCharset

-----------------------
Default option
-----------------------

   LogCharset -- character set for logfiles

Synopsis
--------

      
         <channel="#channel">
          Logfile = "channel.log"
          Format = "xchat"
          Charset = "iso-8859-1"
          LogCharset = "utf-8"
         </channel>

         <set Charset="iso-8859-15">
         <set LogCharset="iso-8859-15">
      
    

Description
-----------

   If LogCharset is set and different from Charset, pisg will convert the
   charset using Text::Iconv. Using this option slows down log processing.

Default

   empty (no conversion)

                               LogCharsetFallback

-----------------------
Default option
-----------------------

   LogCharsetFallback -- fallback character set for logfiles

Synopsis
--------

      
         <channel="#channel">
          Logfile = "channel.log"
          Format = "xchat"
          Charset = "utf-8"
          LogCharset = "utf-8"
          LogCharsetFallback = "iso-8859-1"
         </channel>

         <set Charset="utf-8">
         <set LogCharset="utf-8">
         <set LogCharsetFallback="iso-8859-15">
      
    

Description
-----------

   LogCharsetFallback defines a fallback charset for the LogCharset
   conversion. This is useful if you have mixed unicode/iso-8859-* logs. Pisg
   will first try the conversion from LogCharset. If that fails,
   LogCharsetFallback is used. Note that this only works for charsets where
   certain byte sequences are illegal, like UTF-8. (In short: LogCharset =
   utf-8, LogCharsetFallback = iso-8859-15 works, the other way round does
   not.)

Default

   empty (no fallback conversion)

                                   TimeOffset

-----------------------
Default option
-----------------------

   TimeOffset -- use a different time zone than the local machine

Synopsis
--------

      
         <channel="#channel">
          Logfile = "channel.log"
          Format = "mIRC"
          Maintainer = "John"
          TimeOffset = "+5"
         </channel>

         <set TimeOffset="+2">
      
    

Description
-----------

   By default, pisg uses the time of the local machine to display the time of
   the generated stats. Sometimes when you have a shell on an external box,
   and it's in another country, you want to use another time. This is
   accomplished by the TimeOffset command.

Default

   +0

                                 RegexpAliases

-----------------------
Default option
-----------------------

   RegexpAliases -- use regular expressions in user aliases

Synopsis
--------

      
         <user nick="Joe" alias="Joe\d+">

         <set RegexpAliases="1">
      
    

Description
-----------

   Enabling this option will make all aliases in <user> lines be parsed as
   regular expressions; this setting also applies to the IgnoreWords,
   FoulWords, and ViolentWords settings.

Synopsis
--------

      
         <set CssDir="/usr/share/pisg/layout/">
      
    

Description
-----------

   CssDir is used to define the paths to the CSS files (the ColorSchemes).
   Usually you don't need to change this. This setting is only used when
   statically including the CSS file.

Default

   layout/ (in current directory)

                                HiCell, HiCell2

Synopsis
--------

      
         <set HiCell="#BABADD" HiCell2="#CCCCCC">
         <set HiCell="">
      
    

Description
-----------

   HiCell and HiCell2 define the colors to be used for the color gradient in
   the most active nicks section. They should match your ColorScheme. When
   setting HiCell the empty string (""), pisg will not generate a color
   gradient; you might want to use this with ColorScheme="none" or
   AltColorScheme.

Default

   #BABADD, #CCCCCC

                                    LogType

         <set LogType="Logfile">
      
    

Description
-----------

   The type of logs kept for your channel. Currently only "Logfile" is
   supported, so you don't need to change this option.

   the parsed logs with another program. The file contains the %stats and
   %lines hashes in perl's Data::Dumper format.

Default

   Unset
